# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, rebuilt and redesigned from scratch as a fully static project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project was to challenge myself to revisit an older website and rebuild it with a cleaner structure, better performance, and a more intentional design approach, without relying on any frameworks.

## Features

- Fully static setup (no frameworks)
- Clean and responsive layout
- Optimized assets for fast load times
- Subtle interactive elements using vanilla JavaScript
- Hidden Jujutsu Kaisen easter eggs throughout the site

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Notes

This project is intentionally kept simple and framework-free to emphasize strong fundamentals and maintainability. It also serves as a snapshot of my current approach to building frontend projects.

Feel free to explore the code and easter eggs.
